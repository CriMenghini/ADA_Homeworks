*Remarks for the easy reading of the work*:
The data in use are stored in the folder `Data`, the description is available [here](https://github.com/ADAEPFL/Homework/blob/master/04%20-%20Applied%20ML/DATA.md).
All the functions that are mentioned are stored in separate libraries that are specified at each step. For some of them the reading of the documentation is required to understand how certain results are obtained. 
The *Notebook* organisation is specified in the *Table of contents*.

__Important__: due to the precence of interactive plot, we suggest you to visualize the notebook using the following [link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CriMenghini/ADA_Homeworks/blob/master/Homework_4/Hw_4.ipynb).
